# QTM-347-Machine-Learning-Final-Project

We created a computer vision model for our machine learning class QTM 347. We strove to implement a model that can decipher real vs fake images of people's faces.

The ResNet50.ipynb is where we our used ResNet 50 as our foundational model.

The ViT_Model.ipynb is where we our used the vision transformer model as our foundational model.
